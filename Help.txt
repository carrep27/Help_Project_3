Our project is predicting the stock market via machine learning. 
I am having problems with the S&P500 historical data that I am trying to import/use
The original data is coming from here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelgu95/machine-learning-stocks/master/YAHOO-INDEX_GSPC.csv
which I copied and pasted into an excel file and saved as a CSV (SP.csv)
I also saved the file directly from the githubsite (right click save as csv, this is the YAHOO-INDEX file). 
I have gone back and forth between both files in case there is a formatting issue between the two but theoretically both csv files in the HELP folder are the same

My code appears to work fine if I keep rows 53-61 commented out (along with any othere lines with variables dependent in those rows)
And when I say appears to work fine, I mean because after running, I create a file ('TotalDebtEquitymrq.csv') that has all the data i asked for (with the exception of anything related to S&P)

But when i run rows 53-61 then the 'TotalDebtEquitymrq' file has no data in it other than header rows. 
I added the exception print(str(e)) in row 83 and the main thing printing it 'Date' over and over again
I'm not suree where the disconnect is. 

I am using the S&P data as my baseline as a measure of success for the other stocks.



Files in help folder: 
intraQuarter: Yahoofinance HTML files for past decade on stocks
SP.csv: S&P500 historical data
